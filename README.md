# AOC_2021
Advent of Code 2021 done in Rust, just to learn the language.

Some days are not present/ do not give a full solutionbecause it simply wasn't practial to do it in Rust. I'm thinking of day 19 which was way easier to solve with linear algebra (and thus was done in python with numpy) and day 24 which was solved with some elbow grease and a spreadsheet.
